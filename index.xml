      <description>My first post? ðŸ”—Firstly, Yesterday at [2.07], I participated in new BJJ classes; it was my third attempt to become a new prof. It seems to be ok; I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the single-leg approach, squeezing with the leg, and knee-stand-up. First, when I fall into half-guard, I need to bend a knee under my ass, then push my body into this leg and stand via knee. The last part is to take over the leg and try to push guard.</description>
